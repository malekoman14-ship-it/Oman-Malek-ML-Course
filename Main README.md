Course : Intro to Machine Learning (ITAI - 1371)

Brief Introduction of me : 

I am a student, interested in the understanding of how machine learning works and how it can be applied for real problems. 
Before this lab, I had only basic knowledge of Python and limited understanding of the concepts of ML, so I wanted to get 
some practical experience and build my confidence in the full workflow.

Fascinating Module : 

Module 9 "Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods".
That's engaging, as decision trees are easy to visualize and understand - it's crystal clear why the model made a certain decision. 
Then you get to see how ensemble methods, such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, bring together many trees into one 
to create a far stronger, more accurate model. There is a great balance of intuition and power there that makes the learning both 
fun and practical.
