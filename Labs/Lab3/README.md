In the lab, I iteratively built and refined a machine learning model. 
I learned how deeply data preparation, feature engineering, and evaluation 
are connected with each other and also learned how supervised and unsupervised
learning differed by the presence of an "answer key." My biggest challenge was 
recognizing overfitting from the beginning and revisiting earlier steps in the 
process rather than expecting the model to work the first time.
