In the lab, I explored the full machine learning workflow across multiple modules, 
starting with basic ML concepts and key Python libraries. I learned how to build classifiers, 
analyze the Titanic dataset, clean and prepare data, handle missing values, encode features, 
and apply scaling. I also practiced evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, 
recall, and ROC/AUC. Later, I worked with logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, 
and unsupervised techniques such as K-Means and PCA. The biggest challenges I faced were understanding 
how data preparation affects model performance and choosing the right methods to avoid overfitting while 
improving accuracy.
